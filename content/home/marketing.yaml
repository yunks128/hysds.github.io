    link: /docs/how-hysds-works/
    description: In July 2019, after the Ridgecrest, California earthquakes, NASA’s ARIA team used HySDS to process satellite RADAR data and create maps showing soil changes. The maps helped scientists assess damage and track fault lines, supporting disaster response and recovery efforts. HySDS offers an efficient, open-source solution for managing large-scale data for missions like ARIA, NISAR, and OCO-2.
    highlights:
      - Disaster Response: HySDS processed RADAR data to create maps for earthquake damage assessment.
      - Efficient Data Processing: Provides economical, open-source tools for satellite data analysis.
      - Mission Support: Used in NASA's ARIA, NISAR, and OCO-2 missions for large-scale data management.

  - title: Faceted Search
    description: HySDS takes a unique faceted search approach. Everything from jobs to data products can be faceted. # The ability to facet upon areas in a map allows for fast data processing of highly monitored areas.

  - title: Integrate Cloud Computing and On-Premise Machines
    description: HySDS utilizes cloud services such as AWS to run heavy jobs such as satellite data processing. # Many of these jobs benefit from being run in parallel, so utilizing AWS allows them to be completed in a timely manner. However, light-weight  jobs such as revoking another job, don’t benefit from utilizing cloud services. These light weight jobs, among other jobs,  are performed by NASA’s on-site super computers. HySDS allows for seamless integration, utilizing cloud services when beneficial and on-site workers when it’s not.

  - title: Trigger rules for custom processing
    description: Trigger rules enable automated custom processing. They can simply be added through the Mozart, The Resource Manager. # Trigger rules can be used to do anything from emailing an operator when a job has finished running or retry a failed job.
